        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Computer Engineer</p>
        <p>I am a senior with a major in computer engineering and a minor in general business at Iowa State University.
            I am currently working at John Deere as a part-time student which means that I work at John Deere part time,
            about 10-15 hours per week during school weeks and 40 hours during the summer and holiday weeks. I have worked
            at John Deere since the end of October of 2022. I will have about 2.5 years of experience with John Deere by the
            time I graduate in May of 2025.</p>
