# Course Number
SE 319 - Construction of User Interfaces

# Class Overview
SE 319 was a class focused on using basic HTML/CSS + JavaScript to develop basic websties for the first portion. Then, we began to use React to develop more complex websites, as well as using MongoDB, and other DB services, to simulate a backend (all run locally to avoid server costs). Overall, the premise of the class was to teach basic web development languages and practices.

# Notes
Both the midterm and the final project were done by myself and my partner, Zachary Foote, but the rest of the assignments were done, mostly in class, on my own.

**Disclaimer: All activites and regular assignments were meant to be fairly quick assignments and not meant to be super well-developed or well-thought-out projects. Please keep this in mind when looking at the code for those assignments.
